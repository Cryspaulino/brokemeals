# Project Title - Broke-Meals

## Team Members - Rhett Poole, Levi Nelson, Crystal Paulino Cabrera, Adam Beus, Kaushal Kafle, Joyce Ili

## Software Description - A website hosted on GitHub that will act as a meal planning guide for college students or any other "broke" customers looking for cheap meals. This software will contain a database of recipes, which users can search through by tags. Users will be able to search recipes by their goals, too! Users will also be able to login with their Google account and save favorite recipes to their account.

## Architecture - 
Frameworks: Node.js/React

Programming Languages: HTML/CSS/JavaScript

Data Storage: Firebase Realtime Database

Development Tools: VS Code, GitHub Project & Public Repositories

## Software Features - 
* [ x] List of recipes
* [ x] User Login/Logout
* [ x] Recipe search by tag/goals
* [x ] Recipe search by ingredient
* [ x] Allow users to login and view saved recipes
* [ x] User data and recipes stored in the cloud
* [ ] End-game feature, users will be able to add recipes to the database.
* [ ] Newsletter

## Team Communication - We will communicate through a chat hosted on Microsoft Teams. During class we will work together using LiveShare on VSCode. When we are apart we will make assignments on Teams/GitHub for each member to complete. We have also been meeting outside of class to collaborate.

## Reflections
Things that went well:
1. Dividing tasks and workflow based on strengths. We spread the work out among all team members for their appropriate strengths. Everyone had an equal workload best suited to their abilities.
2. We adapted well when plans changed. Partway through our project, we did a full visual redesign and moved everything into the React framework. Despite these changes, we were able to adapt quickly continue our work.
3. Our code was well-documented. We used comments and in-person discussions to explain our code and precisely what it does. This helped reduce confusion and kept everyone in the loop when things changed.

Things we could do better:
1. Next time, we might not use a Realtime database. Using a Realtime database was convenient because of the JSON structure, but if we were to expand our site's functionality in the future, we might consider using Collections or a different, more robust database structure.
2. More user-friendly features. We would love to add features that would be beneficial to the user, such as printable recipies, user profile settings, and the ability for users to add their own custom recipes. Features that are beneficial to users would grow our userbase and improve the user experience.
3. While we did a good job dividing up the work evenly, there were points in our project where certain individuals were waiting on other individuals to finish their work before they could do their own. If we were to restart this project, we would approach this problem differently by always having a backup plan in mind for when we have to wait, and for identifying earlier what changes need to be made to the site/codebase so there's no need to ask.
